## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
In analyzing the PSI variance across lots, it is clear that Lot 3 does not meet the dictated specification range of below-100 PSI for suspension coils. Measures for the other lots are within the dictated range, as well as the overall PSI variance.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
In order to determine how MechaCar stacks up safety-wise, the I recommend an additional statistical study on safety ratings.
 - Metric to be tested: Vehicle afety ratings
 - Hypothesis: MechaCars safety ratings will be significantly greater than those of other manufacturers.
 - Null hypothesis: There will be no significant difference in safety ratings across manufacturers.
 - Proposed test: A Two-Sample t-Test would compare the distribution means for MechaCars (Sample A) vs a sample of other manufacturers (Sample B).
